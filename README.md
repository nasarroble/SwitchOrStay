# SwitchOrStay

The game is based on the famous Monty hall problem. To summaries, you are presented with three doors, behind one of them is the prize and the other two are non-trivial or losing doors. Once you selected your door, the host reveals one of the doors that does not contain the prize, the host knows the prize door. Now you are given the option of either staying with the current or switching to the other closed door. According to probability it is in your favor to always switch, 2/3 of winning, compare to staying, 1/3 of winning. For more visit:
